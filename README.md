# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Cree Manning**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/triangular-humble-wolfberry?path=README.md%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Y] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [Y] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [Y] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [Y] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [Y] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [Y] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [Y] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Y] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [Y] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [Y] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [N] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [N] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [N] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [N] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [N] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [N] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:
\\None

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
\\Making the game with higher complexity (i.e timer, increase of speed each turn) like a tetris game!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[https://www.w3schools.com/css//css_font_websafe.asp, https://www.designwizard.com/blog/design-trends/colour-combination]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[During this project I was constantly trying to make myself comfortable writing in javascript. I have only been using Python. Although I realized the two languages are not too different, 
I still had to take a step back and read the instructions on some of the basics touched upon during this project. For example, getting used to ''< p >'', opening and closing tags, 
as well as // for making comments underneath code. I had to get comfortable in noticing where opening tags were and how to use them for the button use. Then it came time to implement
the game function code I honestly had a bit more trouble. I did write down my thought process on how to write the function code, and mine was similar in some aspects to the given code 
in the instructions. Just to play it safe I used the given code in my project, being that I’m not comfortable in writing with javascript. I realized I wanted to use another if statement 
underneath the first one but I did not want to make the code lengthy. But then cross checking my work I noticed that I implemented a few lines that were not necessary. I was confused, 
so I reread the upper functions and realized where those unwanted lines of code were used already. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[How was this project able to turn into a game? I’m a little lost on how  these few pages of code were able to open up a whole new page with the word and button placement intact. 
Does the code runtime ever become a huge issue when finishing up different functions, in terms of the space of the application? 
When a website crashes, how easy is it to fix it on the developers end? Is it usually new code implemented or are the old codes still in use?
How do you go into the very fine details of making a website look appealing, such as shadowing, graphics, even confetti popping out?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[After completion of the required implementations of the game, I would spend time on determining if any of the function codes run the best case time,
then I would focus on the overall design and complexity of the game. I would find color combinations that are easy and appealing to the human eye,
and have beginner's, intermediate, and expert levels to the game.Also, if I could have made different theme boards and buttons reflective of the themes I would (i.e candy theme, city theme, safari theme). 
It would also be nice if I could have added some sort of incentive to the game, like if you reach certain levels you win tokens to redeem prizes reflective of different token amounts. ]
